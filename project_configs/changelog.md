## [1.0.8] - 2025-10-17

### Production Bug Fix Release - Database Schema Restoration & RBAC Email Mismatch
- **Database Schema Restored**: Resolved foreign key constraint violation causing 500 errors on chat session creation
- **RBAC Email Mismatch Fixed**: Identified and documented email discrepancy between local database and Salesforce causing RBAC failure
- **LangChain Compatibility**: Fixed ModuleNotFoundError preventing production deployment

### Fixed
- **Database Foreign Key Violation**: chat_sessions.account_id constraint failing due to missing global_default account
  - Root cause: Used create_tables.sql instead of new_script.sql for schema restoration
  - Solution: Executed new_script.sql which includes required account seed data
  - Created 3 accounts: global_default, Costco (0016F000035ZintQAC), Microsoft-Engineering (001fu000006oFIIAA2)
- **RBAC System Failure**: All queries filtering by global_default instead of user's actual Salesforce accounts
  - Root cause: Local DB email (utsahk@infogain.com.invalid) did not match Salesforce email (utsahk@infogain.com)
  - Impact: Salesforce API returned 404 - User not found, system fell back to global_default
  - Solution: User updated local database email to match Salesforce (removed .invalid suffix)
  - Verified: Salesforce user exists with Costco account association via AccountShare
- **LangChain Import Error**: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langchain.schema'
  - Root cause: Deprecated import path in agents/intent_analyzer.py (line 12)
  - Module removed in LangChain >= 0.1.0
  - Solution: Removed unused legacy import (LegacyHumanMessage, LegacySystemMessage)
  - Impact: Server now starts successfully in Python 3.12 production environments

### Verified
- **Pinecone Index Status**: infogain-development index accessible with 7,295 vectors
  - Confirmed both global_default and Costco (0016F000035ZintQAC) partitions exist
  - Metadata filtering working correctly
  - API key: pcsk_4AnYdz_PZpeqBizzFRLsaaBRXDSWHrtrkTDrqTFJ149VgFn76Dsst8LWQXRPUjpo5tqQXm
- **Salesforce Integration**: Verified AccountShare integration working
  - Instance: infogaincorp--invimatic.sandbox.my.salesforce.com
  - API Version: 59.0
  - Test user: Utsah Khianra (utsahk@infogain.com, ID: 0056F000009rZVwQAM)
  - Account association: Costco (0016F000035ZintQAC) confirmed via AccountShare
- **Database Schema**: All 13 tables restored with proper constraints
  - Users: 1 user created
  - Accounts: 3 accounts seeded
  - user_accounts: Empty (relies on Salesforce AccountShare, not local DB)
  - Status: Ready for RBAC testing

### Changed
- **agents/intent_analyzer.py**: Removed line 12 deprecated LangChain import
- **Database User Email**: Updated from utsahk@infogain.com.invalid to utsahk@infogain.com (user action)

### Documentation Added
- 7 utility scripts for database, Salesforce, and Pinecone verification
  - restore_database.py - Execute new_script.sql to restore schema
  - check_db_schema.py - Inspect database tables and constraints
  - check_user_accounts.py - Analyze user-account associations
  - create_test_user.py - Create test users
  - check_salesforce_user.py - Query Salesforce by email
  - check_utsahk_accounts.py - Verify specific user account associations
  - inspect_pinecone_index.py - Query Pinecone index stats and metadata

### Key Learnings
- **Database Schema Management**: new_script.sql is authoritative (includes seed data), create_tables.sql is incomplete
- **RBAC Design Pattern**: Salesforce AccountShare is source of truth, local user_accounts table exists but not used as primary source
- **Email Matching Critical**: .invalid suffix commonly used for test accounts but must match Salesforce exactly
- **Error Diagnosis**: Check logs for account_ids filter values, verify Salesforce user exists before assuming code issue

### Known Limitations
- **Develop Branch Merge**: 23 commits ahead of origin/dev-test-1, merge completed but not pushed
- **Utility Scripts**: 18 untracked diagnostic scripts in root directory
- **End-to-End RBAC Testing**: Pending user test with corrected email configuration

## [1.0.9] - 2025-10-18

### Bug Fix Release - Azure Search Response Cleanup

**Changed**:
- **Deterministic Query Handler**: Removed redundant sources array from link retrieval responses
  - File: [agents/deterministic_query_handler.py:544](../agents/deterministic_query_handler.py#L544)
  - Reason: Sources were duplicated - already present in formatted links markdown
  - Impact: Cleaner response format, reduced response payload size
  - Before: `{"response": "...", "confidence": 0.9, "sources": [...]}`
  - After: `{"response": "...", "confidence": 0.9, "sources": []}`
- **Config Cleanup**: Commented out deprecated azure_search_key field
  - File: [config.py:20](../config.py#L20)
  - Reason: Enforce admin/query key separation (implemented in v1.0.7)
  - Impact: Prevents accidental use of legacy key field
  - Change: `azure_search_key: Optional[str] = None` → `#azure_search_key: Optional[str] = None`

### Uncommitted Follow-up
- **Config Revert** (commit 98bca70, 2025-10-19): Re-enabled azure_search_key field
  - Reason: Developer request - "Only uncommented because Mayur begged me to"
  - Status: Uncommitted change in working directory
  - Impact: Legacy key field available again for backward compatibility

### Known Issues
- **Performance Degradation**: Response times increased to 25+ seconds (vs target <3s P50)
  - Root cause analysis pending
  - Multiple bottlenecks suspected: duplicate queries, uncached operations, sequential processing

- **RAG Agent Clarification Loop**: Addressed persistent clarification responses for synthesis queries by dynamically adjusting the `dynamic_threshold` and `_calculate_weighted_relevance_score` weights in `agents/validators/relevance_validator.py` based on `intent_analysis`. This makes the validation more lenient for generative tasks when confidence is reasonable.

### Changed
- **`.env` Configuration**: Updated `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` to point to the `postgres` database and removed duplicate `POSTGRES_` entries for consistency.
- **Relevance Validation Logic**: Modified `_calculate_dynamic_threshold` and `_calculate_weighted_relevance_score` in `agents/validators/relevance_validator.py` to incorporate `intent_analysis` for more sophisticated and context-aware validation decisions, especially for synthesis-type queries.

  - Modified `agents/intent_analyzer.py` to recognize and route these new intents to the `rag_agent`.
- **LLM-Driven Response Length Control**:
  - Modified `_process_document_query` in `agents/rag_agent.py` to dynamically inject directives into the LLM prompt, instructing it to adhere to length constraints (e.g., "2 min", "100 words max") present in the original query.
- **Suggested Prompts for Expansion**:
  - Implemented logic in `agents/rag_agent.py` to generate 2-3 relevant follow-up questions using an LLM call after a concise response, offering to expand on the content. These are stored in `state["suggested_prompts"]`.

### Fixed
- **Pylance Errors**: Resolved numerous Pylance type-hinting and logic errors across `agents/intent_analyzer.py`, `agents/state.py`, `workflow.py`, `agents/triage_agent.py`, `agents/data_tool.py`, and `agents/rag_agent.py`. This included:

    - `src/models/__init__.py`
    - `src/services/chat_session_service.py`
    - `src/schemas/__init__.py`
    - `src/main.py`

## [0.7.0] - 2025-10-13

### Fixed
- **Critical hallucination detection bug** - Disabled problematic hallucination retry logic that was forcing LLM to fabricate information when it honestly didn't have access to requested data
  - Changed `hallucination_check` to `False` in [agents/rag_agent.py:351](../agents/rag_agent.py#L351)
  - System now respects LLM's honest responses about missing information
  - Removed vicious cycle: honest "I don't know" → flagged as hallucination → retry with "stronger prompt" → forced fabrication
  - Other guardrails remain active: relevance validator, confidence thresholds, entity overlap analysis

### Changed
- Archived outdated documentation with impossible dates and incomplete claims to `archive_20251013/`
  - Moved `changelog_2025_01_10.md` (contained January 2025 dates when current is October 2025)
  - Moved old `dev_log.md` (7535 lines, outdated)
  - Moved session-specific context files

### Added
- Comprehensive development log documenting full diagnostics session (374 lines)
- Added detailed root cause analysis of hallucination detection bug
- Added technical documentation explaining why hallucination retry was fundamentally flawed

### Technical Details
**Root Cause**: The `_response_contains_hallucination()` method assumed that chunk retrieval equals answer availability. When LLM honestly said "I don't know" (because semantically similar chunks didn't actually answer the query), the method flagged it as hallucination and triggered retry with a stronger prompt containing: "CRITICAL: Do NOT respond with 'I do not have access' when source documents are provided. Your task is to ALWAYS generate useful content". This forced the LLM to fabricate information.

**Impact**: Zero risk single-line change. System now provides honest responses when data is unavailable while maintaining all other quality controls.

## System Architecture Overview

### Current Stack (v0.7)
- **Framework**: FastAPI + LangGraph
- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- **Embeddings**: text-embedding-3-large
- **Vector DB**: Pinecone (infogain-development-test index)
- **Cache**: Azure Redis (ignisflow-redis)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Python**: 3.13.7

### Core Features (All Versions)
- Universal instruction system (chunk-driven, not detection-driven)
- Multi-agent orchestration with LangGraph
- Semantic caching with Redis + embedding similarity
- L1/L2 memory caching (5-turn conversation window)
- Input/output guardrails with security validation
- Intent analysis and triage routing
- Fast-path detection for greetings and deterministic queries
- Token-aware chunk selection (128K context window)
- SharePoint and Salesforce integration (configured)

### Quality Controls
- Relevance validator (entity overlap, keyword coverage)
- Confidence-based query handling (reject <0.2, clarify <0.45)
- Context reference detection (implicit pronouns)
- SQL injection and jailbreak detection
- OpenAI moderation API integration

### Performance Targets
- P50: ≤2.5s
- P95: ≤6s
- Concurrent users: 100+

---

## Known Limitations

### Active Limitations (v0.7)
1. **Debug Print Statements**: 32 occurrences in rag_agent.py (not production logging)
2. **Multi-pass Generation**: Disabled (causes 30+ second timeouts)
3. **Response Validator**: Disabled (part of multi-pass timeout issue)
4. **Refinement Queries**: Not implemented (stashed work was incomplete and dropped)

### Disabled Features
- Hallucination retry logic (v0.7) - Fundamentally flawed approach
- Multi-pass generation - Timeout issues
- Response validator - Tied to multi-pass generation

---

## Migration Notes

### Upgrading to v0.7
No breaking changes. Single line modification in rag_agent.py. Server restart required to load changes.

### Upgrading to v0.6
No breaking changes. Removed dead code file (document_coordinator.py).
