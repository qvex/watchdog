# Project Brief: Watchdog

## Executive Summary

**PROJECT NAME**: Watchdog
**PROJECT TYPE**: Interactive Python Learning Assistant
**OBJECTIVE**: Create an engaging learning tool that monitors Python files and provides progressive hints when learners delete code, facilitating hands-on practice and skill development
**TIMELINE**: Initial template complete, ready for enhancement and LLM integration

## Project Mission

### Core Problem Statement
Beginning Python developers often struggle with learning by reading alone. They need hands-on practice with immediate, contextual feedback that guides them through the learning process without giving away answers too quickly. Traditional tutorials lack interactivity, while existing tools either provide no hints or complete solutions without progressive guidance.

### Primary Solution Approach
Implementation of a file monitoring system that detects when learners delete code (indicating practice intent) and provides a 4-level progressive hint system:
1. Conceptual hints (what to think about)
2. Structural hints (what components are needed)
3. Syntax hints (how to write it)
4. Code examples (complete solution)

The system uses AST analysis to understand what was deleted and provides contextually appropriate hints with best practice suggestions.

## Business Context

### Target Use Cases
- **Deliberate Practice**: Learners delete working code to practice rewriting it themselves
- **Guided Learning**: Progressive hints prevent frustration while encouraging problem-solving
- **Best Practice Integration**: Learn correct patterns and Pythonic idioms during practice
- **VS Code Integration**: Seamless learning experience within familiar development environment

### Key Stakeholders
- **Python Learners**: Primary users seeking hands-on practice with guidance
- **Educators**: Teachers who can assign practice exercises with built-in hints
- **Course Creators**: Content developers extending the system with custom hint patterns
- **Open Source Community**: Contributors enhancing the hint engine and patterns

## Technical Objectives

### Primary Technical Goals
1. **Real-time File Monitoring**: Sub-second detection of code deletions using watchdog library
2. **Intelligent Code Analysis**: AST-based pattern recognition for loops, functions, classes, etc.
3. **Progressive Hint System**: 4-level hint escalation with time-based progression
4. **VS Code Integration**: Rich terminal output with styled panels and progress indicators
5. **Session Management**: Learning session tracking with history and analytics

### Architecture Components
- **File Watcher** (src/file_watcher.py): Observer pattern for file change detection
- **Code Analyzer** (src/code_analyzer.py): AST parsing and pattern recognition
- **Hint Engine** (src/hint_engine.py): Progressive hint generation and best practices
- **State Manager** (src/state_manager.py): Session tracking and progress monitoring
- **VS Code Integration** (src/vscode_integration.py): Terminal UI with rich formatting
- **Main Coordinator** (main.py): Application orchestration and CLI interface

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- **Deletion Detection**: Accurate identification of deleted lines and functions within 0.5s
- **Pattern Recognition**: Support for loops, conditionals, functions, classes, comprehensions
- **Hint Quality**: Contextually appropriate hints with increasing specificity across 4 levels
- **Session Tracking**: Complete learning history with time tracking and completion status
- **User Experience**: Clear, encouraging feedback through rich terminal formatting

### Performance Benchmarks
- **File Watch Latency**: <0.5s from file save to change detection
- **AST Analysis**: <100ms for typical Python files (<1000 lines)
- **Hint Generation**: <50ms for template-based hints
- **Memory Footprint**: <50MB for typical learning session
- **Startup Time**: <2s from command execution to ready state

### Quality Standards
- **Code Quality**: Type hints, docstrings, PEP 8 compliance
- **Testing Coverage**: Unit tests for core components (analyzer, hint engine, state manager)
- **Documentation**: Complete README with usage examples and extension guide
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and graceful degradation

## Project Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- **Python Version**: Requires Python 3.8+ for type hints and AST features
- **File Watching**: Limited to local filesystem (no network drives)
- **Performance**: Debounce mechanism (0.5s) prevents rapid-fire hint spam
- **Terminal Dependency**: Requires terminal access for rich output display

### Business Constraints
- **Open Source**: MIT license for community contribution and extension
- **Educational Focus**: Designed for learning, not production code analysis
- **VS Code Assumption**: Optimized for VS Code terminal integration
- **Learning Curve**: Requires basic understanding of file watching concept

### Operational Constraints
- **Single File Monitoring**: Watches one file at a time per instance
- **Session Scope**: No cross-session learning (each session is independent)
- **Local State**: Session data stored in memory (not persisted across restarts)
- **Template-Based**: Initial hints from templates (LLM integration planned)

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **AST Parsing Failures**: Incomplete or invalid Python code may break parser
- **Pattern Recognition Gaps**: May not detect all code patterns accurately
- **Hint Quality**: Template-based hints may not fit all contexts perfectly
- **File System Race Conditions**: Rapid edits might trigger multiple events

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Graceful Degradation**: Try-except blocks around AST parsing with fallback hints
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests covering edge cases and malformed code
- **Extensible Design**: Pattern templates easily customizable via hints/patterns.json
- **Debounce Mechanism**: 0.5s delay prevents duplicate event handling
- **Clear Documentation**: Usage guide and troubleshooting section in README

## Development Approach

### Methodology Framework
**Process Model**: Iterative development with user feedback incorporation
**Quality Gates**: Pre-implementation validation protocol from session-start-checklist.md
**Communication Standards**: Professional, technical documentation without unnecessary jargon
**Documentation Requirements**: Code comments for complex logic, docstrings for all public APIs

### Implementation Strategy
**Phase 1**: Template implementation (COMPLETE - from outline.md)
**Phase 2**: Testing and validation with real-world practice files
**Phase 3**: LLM integration for dynamic hint generation
**Phase 4**: Custom hint pattern system and extensibility features
**Phase 5**: Progress dashboard and analytics visualization

### Evaluation Framework
**User Testing**: Real learners using the system with practice exercises
**Performance Monitoring**: Latency tracking for file watch and hint generation
**Hint Effectiveness**: User surveys on hint quality and learning outcomes
**Code Quality Metrics**: Test coverage, type hint coverage, PEP 8 compliance

## Expected Outcomes

### Immediate Deliverables
- **Functional Learning Assistant**: Complete watchdog-based file monitoring system
- **Progressive Hint System**: 4-level hints for loops, functions, conditionals
- **VS Code Integration**: Rich terminal output with styled panels
- **Session Tracking**: Learning history and progress monitoring
- **Example Practice File**: Working example demonstrating all features

### Long-term Benefits
- **Enhanced Learning Outcomes**: Faster skill acquisition through deliberate practice
- **Extensible Platform**: Foundation for custom hint patterns and topic modules
- **Community Contributions**: Open source ecosystem of hint patterns and exercises

## Future Enhancement Roadmap

### Phase 3: LLM Integration (Planned)
