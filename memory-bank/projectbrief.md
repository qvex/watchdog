# Project Brief: Watchdog

## Executive Summary

**PROJECT NAME**: Watchdog
**PROJECT TYPE**: AI-Powered Code Completion Tool
**OBJECTIVE**: Create an intelligent inline code completion assistant similar to GitHub Copilot that provides context-aware code suggestions and learning-focused hints for Python development in VS Code
**TIMELINE**: VS Code extension complete with inline completion provider and Python backend

## Project Mission

### Core Problem Statement
Beginning Python developers need intelligent, context-aware coding assistance that helps them learn while they code. Traditional code completion tools either provide no guidance or give complete solutions without educational value. Learners need a tool that understands their full codebase context and provides appropriate hints, patterns, and suggestions that facilitate learning without simply writing code for them.

### Primary Solution Approach
Implementation of a VS Code extension with an inline completion provider that delivers context-aware code suggestions as ghost text while typing:
1. Full-file context analysis to understand the codebase
2. Inline ghost text suggestions that appear as you type
3. Help comment feature (type `# help [description]`) for targeted code generation
4. Learning-focused hints that show patterns and syntax rather than just complete solutions
5. Smart context detection to only suggest when code is incomplete

The system uses an LLM-powered Python backend to analyze code context and generate appropriate suggestions with best practice patterns.

## Business Context

### Target Use Cases
- **Active Coding Assistance**: Real-time code suggestions as you type in VS Code
- **Guided Learning**: Context-aware hints that teach patterns rather than just providing answers
- **Help-on-Demand**: Type `# help [description]` to get targeted code generation for specific needs
- **Best Practice Integration**: Learn correct patterns and Pythonic idioms through intelligent suggestions
- **VS Code Integration**: Seamless inline completion experience similar to GitHub Copilot

### Key Stakeholders
- **Python Learners**: Primary users seeking hands-on practice with guidance
- **Educators**: Teachers who can assign practice exercises with built-in hints
- **Course Creators**: Content developers extending the system with custom hint patterns
- **Open Source Community**: Contributors enhancing the hint engine and patterns

## Technical Objectives

### Primary Technical Goals
1. **Inline Completion Provider**: VS Code extension providing ghost text suggestions as you type
2. **Full-Context Code Analysis**: LLM-powered understanding of entire file context, not just cursor area
3. **Context-Aware Suggestions**: Smart detection of when to show hints vs. when code is complete
4. **Help Comment System**: Special `# help` trigger for targeted code generation
5. **Learning-Focused Hints**: Provide patterns and syntax guidance rather than complete solutions

### Architecture Components
- **VS Code Extension** (vscode-extension/src/): TypeScript extension with inline completion provider
  - extension.ts: Main extension activation and lifecycle
  - inlineCompletionProvider.ts: Provides ghost text suggestions
  - backendManager.ts: Manages Python backend process
  - httpClient.ts: Communicates with Python backend
- **Python Backend** (src/llm/): LLM-powered hint generation service
  - hint_service.py: Processes code context and generates suggestions
- **Optional File Monitor** (watch_and_hint.py): Standalone file watching for terminal-based hints

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- **Inline Completion**: Real-time ghost text suggestions as user types in VS Code
- **Context Understanding**: Full-file analysis to understand code structure and intent
- **Help Comments**: `# help [description]` triggers targeted code generation
- **Smart Filtering**: Only show suggestions when code is incomplete or explicitly requested
- **User Experience**: Non-intrusive ghost text without squiggly lines or hover delays

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Completion Latency**: <500ms from typing to ghost text appearance
- **Backend Response**: <300ms for LLM-based hint generation
- **Context Analysis**: Full-file analysis completed within completion latency budget
- **Memory Footprint**: <100MB for VS Code extension + Python backend
- **Startup Time**: <3s for extension activation and backend initialization

### Quality Standards
- **Code Quality**: Type hints, docstrings, PEP 8 compliance
- **Testing Coverage**: Unit tests for core components (analyzer, hint engine, state manager)
- **Documentation**: Complete README with usage examples and extension guide
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and graceful degradation

## Project Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- **Python Version**: Requires Python 3.8+ for type hints and AST features
- **File Watching**: Limited to local filesystem (no network drives)
- **Performance**: Debounce mechanism (0.5s) prevents rapid-fire hint spam
- **Terminal Dependency**: Requires terminal access for rich output display

### Business Constraints
- **Open Source**: MIT license for community contribution and extension
- **Educational Focus**: Designed for learning, not production code analysis
- **VS Code Assumption**: Optimized for VS Code terminal integration
- **Learning Curve**: Requires basic understanding of file watching concept

### Operational Constraints
- **Single File Monitoring**: Watches one file at a time per instance
- **Session Scope**: No cross-session learning (each session is independent)
- **Local State**: Session data stored in memory (not persisted across restarts)
- **Template-Based**: Initial hints from templates (LLM integration planned)

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **AST Parsing Failures**: Incomplete or invalid Python code may break parser
- **Pattern Recognition Gaps**: May not detect all code patterns accurately
- **Hint Quality**: Template-based hints may not fit all contexts perfectly
- **File System Race Conditions**: Rapid edits might trigger multiple events

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Graceful Degradation**: Try-except blocks around AST parsing with fallback hints
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests covering edge cases and malformed code
- **Extensible Design**: Pattern templates easily customizable via hints/patterns.json
- **Debounce Mechanism**: 0.5s delay prevents duplicate event handling
- **Clear Documentation**: Usage guide and troubleshooting section in README

## Development Approach

### Methodology Framework
**Process Model**: Iterative development with user feedback incorporation
**Quality Gates**: Pre-implementation validation protocol from session-start-checklist.md
**Communication Standards**: Professional, technical documentation without unnecessary jargon
**Documentation Requirements**: Code comments for complex logic, docstrings for all public APIs

### Implementation Strategy
**Phase 1**: Template implementation (COMPLETE - from outline.md)
**Phase 2**: Testing and validation with real-world practice files
**Phase 3**: LLM integration for dynamic hint generation
**Phase 4**: Custom hint pattern system and extensibility features
**Phase 5**: Progress dashboard and analytics visualization

### Evaluation Framework
**User Testing**: Real learners using the system with practice exercises
**Performance Monitoring**: Latency tracking for file watch and hint generation
**Hint Effectiveness**: User surveys on hint quality and learning outcomes
**Code Quality Metrics**: Test coverage, type hint coverage, PEP 8 compliance

## Expected Outcomes

### Immediate Deliverables
- **VS Code Extension**: Fully functional inline completion provider for Python
- **Context-Aware Suggestions**: LLM-powered code completion with full-file understanding
