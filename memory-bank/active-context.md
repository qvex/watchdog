# Active Context: Watchdog Development

## Current Development Phase

**ACTIVE PHASE**: VS Code Extension Complete
**PRIMARY FOCUS**: Inline code completion with LLM-powered hints
**CURRENT STATUS**: Functional VS Code extension with Python backend
**CURRENT VERSION**: v0.2.0 (Extension Complete)
**NEXT PHASE**: Enhanced LLM features and multi-language support

## Project Overview

**PROJECT**: Watchdog
**ARCHITECTURE**: VS Code extension with inline completion provider + Python LLM backend
**OBJECTIVE**: AI-powered code completion tool similar to GitHub Copilot, providing context-aware suggestions and learning-focused hints

## Current Implementation Context

### System Architecture (Production Complete)

**Core Components**:
1. **VS Code Extension** (vscode-extension/src/) - TypeScript inline completion provider
   - extension.ts - Main extension lifecycle
   - inlineCompletionProvider.ts - Ghost text suggestions
   - backendManager.ts - Backend process management
   - httpClient.ts - Backend communication
2. **Python Backend** (src/llm/) - LLM-powered hint generation
   - hint_service.py - Context analysis and code generation
3. **Optional File Monitor** (watch_and_hint.py) - Terminal-based code monitoring

### Technical Stack
- **Extension**: TypeScript + VS Code Extension API
- **Backend**: Python 3.8+ with LLM integration
- **Communication**: HTTP REST API (localhost)
- **Optional Tools**: watchdog 3.0.0 (file monitoring), rich 13.7.0 (terminal UI)

## Current Development Status (v0.2.0)

### Production Implementation Status

#### VS Code Extension (COMPLETE)
- ✅ **Inline Completion Provider**: Ghost text suggestions as you type
- ✅ **Backend Integration**: HTTP communication with Python service
- ✅ **Automatic Backend Management**: Starts/stops backend automatically
- ✅ **Context Detection**: Smart filtering for when to show suggestions
- ✅ **Help Comments**: `# help ...` trigger for code generation

#### Component Status

**1. VS Code Extension (COMPLETE - Production)**
- extension.ts: Main activation and lifecycle management
- inlineCompletionProvider.ts: Provides ghost text inline completions
- backendManager.ts: Manages Python backend process lifecycle
- httpClient.ts: HTTP REST API communication with backend
- Configuration: backendPort (5555), enableDiagnostics settings

**Key Features**:
- Inline completion registration for Python files
- Full-file context sent with each request
- Help comment detection (`# help ...`)
- Smart context filtering (no suggestions if text after cursor or return/pass exists)
- Automatic markdown stripping from LLM responses
- Help comments insert on new line below comment

**2. Python LLM Backend (COMPLETE - Production)**
- hint_service.py: LLM-powered code analysis and generation
- CodeContext dataclass: file_path, code_snippet, change_type, language
- generate_code_hint(): Main hint generation function
- Effects pattern: Success/Failure for error handling

**Hint Generation Modes**:
- `help_comment`: Code generation from natural language description
- `learning_hint`: Next logical code step with patterns (not full solution)
- `context_completion`: Context-aware code continuation suggestions

**3. Optional File Monitor (COMPLETE - Production)**
- watch_and_hint.py: Standalone terminal-based file monitoring
- CodeHintHandler: Watches Python files for modifications
- Extracts last 50 lines on file change
- Sends to hint service and displays in terminal
- Code normalization to prevent duplicate processing

## Implementation Details

### Inline Completion Provider Implementation
**Key Features**:
- Registers inline completion provider for Python files
- Triggers on typing (provideInlineCompletionItems called by VS Code)
- Sends full document context to backend with each request
- Smart filtering: no suggestions if text after cursor
- Help comment detection: `# help ...` triggers code generation
- Pattern vs. solution mode based on change_type

**Request Flow**:
1. User types in Python file
2. Extension checks context (cursor position, line content, etc.)
3. If appropriate, sends HintRequest to backend
4. Backend analyzes full code and generates suggestion
5. Extension displays as ghost text at cursor

**Performance**:
- Extension processing: <100ms
- Backend request: <300ms
- Total latency: <500ms

### Backend Hint Generation Implementation
**Hint Generation Modes**:
- **help_comment**: Natural language to code (e.g., "# help write a function to add two numbers")
- **learning_hint**: Next logical step with patterns, not complete solution
- **context_completion**: Suggests next 1-3 lines based on context

**Context Sent to Backend**:
```json
{
  "full_code": "[entire file content]",
  "current_line": "[line where cursor is]",
  "text_before_cursor": "[text before cursor on current line]",
  "line_number": 42,
  "is_empty_line": false,
  "change_type": "learning_hint"
}
```

**LLM Prompting Strategy**:
- help_comment: Generate 2-8 lines of code from description
- learning_hint: Provide single-line hint for next step
- Markdown stripping: Removes ```python code blocks
- Error detection: Identifies syntax errors and suggests fixes

## Next Steps and Priorities

### Immediate Next Steps (Priority 1)

**Testing and Refinement**:
1. Test inline completions with various Python code patterns
2. Measure and optimize completion latency
3. Test help comment feature with different descriptions
4. Verify smart context detection edge cases
5. Test backend error handling and recovery

**User Experience**:
1. Fine-tune when suggestions appear vs. don't appear
2. Improve learning hint quality (patterns vs. solutions)
3. Test with real users for feedback
4. Add user configuration options

### Short-term Goals (Priority 2)

**Enhanced LLM Features** (v0.3.0 - Planned):
- Multiple LLM provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
- Personalized learning paths based on user patterns
- Natural language explanations for suggested code
- User preference learning and adaptation

**Performance Optimization**:
1. Response caching for common patterns
2. Reduce completion latency to <300ms total
3. Optimize full-file context analysis
4. Add request queuing and prioritization

### Long-term Goals (Priority 3)

**Multi-Language Support** (v0.4.0 - Planned):
- JavaScript/TypeScript inline completions
- Support for Go, Rust, Java
- Language-specific best practices
- Cross-language pattern recognition

**Advanced Features** (v0.5.0 - Planned):
- Code refactoring suggestions
- Bug detection and fix suggestions
- Test generation assistance
- Documentation generation

## Known Limitations and Considerations

### Current Limitations
1. **Python-Only**: Currently only supports Python files (multi-language planned)
2. **VS Code Dependency**: Requires VS Code to use extension features
3. **Backend Requirement**: Python backend must be running for suggestions
4. **Completion Latency**: 300-500ms may feel slow compared to local completions
5. **No Caching**: Each request analyzed independently (no learning/caching yet)

### Design Decisions
1. **Stateless Backend**: Each request independent, full context sent each time
2. **HTTP Communication**: Simple REST API between extension and backend
3. **Smart Filtering**: Only suggest when code incomplete (no text after cursor)
4. **Learning Mode**: Prioritize hints/patterns over complete solutions
5. **Help Comments**: Explicit trigger (`# help`) for code generation

### Edge Cases Handled
1. **Text After Cursor**: No suggestions if user in middle of line
2. **Complete Code**: No suggestions if return/pass already exists
3. **Help Comment Placement**: Inserts on new line below comment
4. **Markdown Stripping**: Removes ```python blocks from LLM responses
5. **Backend Failures**: Graceful error handling, logs to output channel

## Development Workflow

**Current Workflow**: Production extension with LLM-powered backend
**Next Workflow**: Enhanced features and multi-language support
**Future Workflow**: Advanced refactoring and bug detection

**Quality Standards**:
- TypeScript strict mode for extension
- Type hints for all Python functions
- Effects pattern for error handling (Success/Failure)
- PEP 8 compliance (Python), ESLint (TypeScript)
- Comprehensive error logging

**Testing Strategy**:
- Manual testing with various Python patterns (current)
- Unit tests for hint generation logic (planned)
- Integration tests for extension-backend communication (planned)
- Performance benchmarking and optimization (planned)
- User testing for UX refinement (future)

This active context reflects v0.2.0 development state with VS Code extension complete and operational inline code completion similar to GitHub Copilot.
